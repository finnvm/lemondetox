In this article, we'll explore the role of lemon detox in a balanced diet, its benefits, and practical tips for incorporating it into your daily meals.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Lemon Detox in a Balanced Diet</h2>
<h3>1. Rich in Nutrients</h3>
<p>Lemons are packed with essential nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants. These nutrients support immune function, skin health, and overall vitality.</p>
